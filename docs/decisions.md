# Decisions

Short log of settled decisions. Newest at the bottom. Update when something changes; don't re-debate settled items without new information.

## Platforms and toolchain
- **Windows now, macOS required.** Dev happens on Windows (VS Code + clangd + MSVC + Ninja). macOS support is mandatory: the user's target setup is a headless Mac mini. Don't pick Windows-only rendering tech.
- **JUCE 9** (submodule on master, 9.0.1+).
- **Formats:** Standalone, VST3, CLAP on Windows. Re-add `AU` to `FORMATS` before any macOS/CI build (the CI workflow expects AU on macOS).
- **Debug by default**; Release in `Builds-Release/` for performance testing.
- **GitHub Actions:** triggers off (manual only) while the repo is private, to save minutes.

## Performance targets
- UI frame rate: **30 fps hard floor, 60 fps goal.** "Smooth when a control is touched" is acceptable during style prototyping; optimise hard after the style is settled, but architect for performance from the start.
- **Keep the CPU for DSP.** Offload UI rendering to the GPU wherever possible. Audio and UI run on separate threads (JUCE audio thread vs message thread); keep all UI work off the audio thread.

## Product shape
- **A live-performance control panel and plugin host.** It hosts the user's licensed desktop plugins (iZotope, Kilohearts, FabFilter, Serum 2, Sylenth1, ...) and centralises/abstracts their controls and routing: audio, MIDI and parameters, with two-way parameter comms (live writes; live reads, pushed where the plugin reports changes, periodic resync otherwise).
- **One shared engine, two shells.** Engine = routing graph + plugin hosting + control protocol. Shells: a **plugin** (VST3 first; tested in FL Studio and FL's Patcher) now, a **standalone app** (headless Mac mini in the live rig) later. Keep the engine free of shell-specific code.
- Two-way control of *sibling* plugins in a DAW is impossible via plugin APIs; that's why target plugins are hosted *inside* our plugin.
- **"Brainlessly easy" to run live:** auto-start, restore last session, pick audio device by name, pre-flight status screen, dedicated travel router, tablet opens a saved web app. Mostly standalone-app/setup concerns; design for it.
- **Modularity / failure isolation:** level A now (UI/network failure never affects audio; UI reconnects and resyncs). Level B (watchdog + auto-restart + session restore) is a bonus, standalone only. Level C (plugins in separate processes) later; don't block it architecturally.
- **Hardware MIDI controllers** go straight into the host machine for note playing; the tablet is for control, not timing-critical notes.
- **Max/MSP is not in the core.** RNBO (exports C++ for JUCE) is a possible later route for the user's own DSP modules.

## Target production form (user's brief, 2026-09-25)
In effect a pseudo-wrapper for a mini-DAW: a patcher-style routing matrix with the user's own UI design language and UX decisions on top. The blueprint docs will expand on this.
- **Hosting and routing:** an arbitrary (configurable) number of generators, routed to an arbitrary number of buses; each bus holds an arbitrary number of FX slots. Any slot (hosted plugin) can route or sidechain to any other slot on any bus: fully modular, grid-style routing.
- **Exposed parameters:** each FX slot (in its default mode, at least) exposes a configurable set of parameters linked to its hosted plugin. Only the parameters the user chooses are exposed, in one consistent format and style matching the design theme.
- **Live performance UX:** stored parameter sets act as waypoints; transitions between them follow arbitrary automation curves or settings, interpolating groups of parameters together.
- **Design:** the glassmorphism/light style; by virtue of its design, the UI doubles as a stage visualiser.
- **Why:** no DAW offers the configurability the user's sound design and composition workflow needs, or the aesthetics wanted on stage.
- **Origin:** processing and cross-processing FX streams from parallel Serum 2 and Sylenth1 instances fed by one MIDI input.

### Architectural implications (agent's reading; revisit with the blueprint)
- **Routing is data.** The engine should build its graph from a saved, editable routing model (slots, buses, connections), not hard-coded wiring. `juce::AudioProcessorGraph` supports adding and removing nodes and connections while running.
- **Sidechains and multiple ins/outs:** the current stereo-only rule (aux buses disabled) must go; slots need addressable input/output buses.
- **A parameter-mapping layer per slot:** which hosted parameters are exposed, with display names, ranges and curves. Plugins expose hundreds (Serum 2: 541 automatable).
- **Waypoint interpolation lives in the engine, not the UI,** so transitions stay smooth regardless of UI frame rate or network, and keep running with the UI disconnected.
- **Scale:** many generators and FX on one audio thread won't last; plan for multi-core graph processing (and level C process isolation) later.
- **Visualiser:** the UI will likely want live audio-derived data (levels, spectra) streamed from the engine.

## UI architecture
- **Svelte 5 + Vite + TypeScript** web UI in `ui/` (monorepo). Shown inside the plugin editor via JUCE's `WebBrowserComponent` (WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS) and on tablets/displays via their browser. Release builds embed the built UI.
- **Own WebSocket protocol from day one** for both the local editor and remote devices (one code path). Security: bind to `127.0.0.1` only until LAN mode exists; require a per-session random token on connect; check the `Origin` header (prevents other web pages on the same machine from connecting); serve only files from the UI bundle (no path traversal). LAN mode later: explicit opt-in, pairing code, consider TLS.
- **All glass visuals are rendered in WebGL2 with custom shaders**, not CSS. The panel scene is rendered to textures on a canvas; DOM only for things like text overlays where useful. WebGPU is a possible later upgrade; keep rendering code structured to allow it.
- Required shader capabilities (all available in WebGL2): explicit texture wrap modes (`CLAMP_TO_EDGE`) and/or manual UV clamping in shaders, render-to-texture passes with exact capture bounds, floating-point render targets (`RGBA16F` via `EXT_color_buffer_float`) so additive energy can exceed 1.0 before tone mapping, custom blend maths (additive, plus-lighter, dodge, etc).
- **Signature effect: "edge-clamped convolution blooming".** A thin bright border, when overlapped by a blurred additive element, blooms massively because the blur samples outside the captured bounds as the duplicated edge row (clamp, not transparent). Implement it deliberately (exact capture bounds + clamped sampling + HDR additive compositing), with controllable parameters (bloom gain, extent, per-edge), rather than depending on a browser artifact.

## Rendering / blur (historical)
- The JUCE-native GlassToggleButton prototype (parent snapshot + `applyGaussianBlurEffect`) was a workflow test only. Deleted in 1a (recoverable from commit `3d7b75c`).

## Workflow
- **Style tokens:** all visual constants live in one place, in the web UI (JSON/TS), with a debug tuning panel (sliders/colour pickers, copy/save). Vite hot reload gives live editing. (Replaces the earlier C++ JSON token plan.)
- **Specs:** split into small files under `docs/` (see index in `CLAUDE.md`), not one monolithic blueprint. Behaviour lives in each component's spec; global material rules in `docs/style/glass.md`.
- **Assets:** one SVG per component with named layer ids; states are usually parameters applied in code, not separate files. Separate state SVGs only when geometry actually morphs (matching path structure).
- **Iteration:** FL Studio / Patcher (via the VST3 junction) for in-DAW checks; web UI iterated in a browser with Vite hot reload where possible.
- **Platforms in practice:** build and test on Windows first; keep platform-specific code isolated; test the web UI in Safari early; smoke-test on a Mac at milestones.

## Plan: thin vertical slice (each sub-slice needs the user's go, ideally its own chat session)
1. **1a. Host inside the plugin:** our VST3 loads one VST3 from a fixed path (test plugin: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\Kilohearts\kHs 3-Band EQ.vst3`), passes audio and MIDI through, can open its editor window, lists its parameters. C++ only, no scanning. **Built and FL-verified 2026-09-25** (audio, hosted editor, live values, state in projects and Fruity Wrapper presets). Patcher had no MIDI event input, which led to 1a.2.
   - **1a.2. Instrument + parallel generators:** switch to an instrument; Serum 2 and Sylenth1 in parallel on one MIDI input, summed into the kHs EQ, plus a MIDI pass-through lane. **Built 2026-09-25; FL check pending.**
2. **1b. Bridge:** embedded HTTP + WebSocket server (C++ library via CPM, to be chosen), plugin editor shows a minimal Svelte page; one plain slider controls one hosted parameter two-way, including pushed updates when the hosted plugin's own UI changes it.
3. **1c. Shader knob:** the slider becomes a WebGL2 glass/light-scatter knob with a frame-time readout, running inside FL.
- Style work starts after 1c.

## Slice 1a: hosting (2026-09-25)
- **Web UI re-confirmed** after weighing JUCE-only: the Mac is headless, so the tablet is the real screen and a web UI is needed anyway; one Svelte app serves both. 1b/1c double as go/no-go tests for WebView2 inside FL. Fallback: plain JUCE editor in the DAW, web UI still serving tablets over the same protocol.
- **Effect now, instrument soon.** FL only sends piano-roll notes to generators, and hosting synths is core. *(Done in 1a.2, earlier than planned.)*
- **Engine code lives in `source/engine/`.** *(1a.2: `Engine` runs a routing graph; `HostedPlugin` is one slot in it.)* Plugins load once on the message thread when our processor is created. No hot-swap yet; swapping while audio runs needs a realtime-safe handover later.
- **Stereo only:** our buses and the hosted plugin's main buses; its sidechain/aux buses are disabled.
- **MIDI:** ours goes into the hosted plugin and its MIDI output becomes ours. Plugins with no MIDI in or out (like the EQ) leave MIDI untouched, so it flows past them. *(Superseded in 1a.2: MIDI routing is explicit graph wiring.)*
- **Saved state:** every DAW's wrapper saves a plugin as an opaque blob it asks the plugin for, so we store the hosted plugin's state inside ours (XML, tagged with the plugin's identifier) and only restore it into the same plugin.
- **Threading:** hosted VST3s require `prepareToPlay` and get/set state on the message thread (JUCE asserts). VST3 hosts call ours there, so we forward directly.
- **VST3 parameter lists include MIDI CC slots** (16 channels x 130 controllers); the EQ reports 6 real + 2080 MIDI. `HostedPlugin::getControls()` returns only the real controls (flagged automatable), and the UI shows only those. Expand later for plugins that need longer lists.
- **Our own plugin exposes the same 2080 MIDI CC slots:** JUCE turns on MIDI CC emulation whenever MIDI input is enabled. VST3 has no MIDI CC events; hosts deliver CC, pitch bend and aftertouch as these parameters, so keep it on.
- **Patcher offers no MIDI event input pin** on our plugin (as an effect), though our VST3 declares a proper event input bus and MIDI out works. Likely FL's effect/generator split again; the 1a.2 instrument switch should fix it (FL check pending).
- Test plugin path: `hostedPluginPath` in `source/PluginProcessor.h`. Loading it adds ~0.2 s to processor construction. *(1a.2: replaced by `serum2Path`, `sylenth1Path`, `eqPath`.)*

## Slice 1a.2: instrument + parallel generators (2026-09-25)
- **Instrument only (`IS_SYNTH`), same plugin ID;** no FX variant for now. FL lists it under Generators after a rescan. Old test projects with it on a mixer insert are expendable.
- **The engine is a `juce::AudioProcessorGraph`:** boxes (plugins) and wires (connections). It fans MIDI out, sums audio where wires meet, delay-matches parallel paths, and swaps in routing changes safely while audio runs. It processes plugins one after another on one audio thread.
- **Fixed test routing:** MIDI in -> Serum 2 and Sylenth1 in parallel -> summed into the kHs 3-Band EQ -> audio out; MIDI in -> MIDI out (pass-through lane; bypass controls later). Set by `Engine::build (generators, fxChain)`, with the FX chain wired in series.
- **Slots have roles:** generator slots only take instruments, FX slots only effects. Needed because one VST3 file can hold several plugins (`Serum2.vst3` holds both Serum 2 and Serum 2 FX).
- **Saved state is per slot** (slot index plus plugin identifier), so two copies of the same plugin each get their own settings back.
- **A failed load keeps its slot** with an error message; everything else still loads and plays.
- **Measured:** Serum 2 loads in ~0.5 s and exposes 541 of 2623 parameters as controls; Sylenth1 ~4 s, 246 of 2326; the EQ 6 of 2086. The "Boot performance" benchmark now runs 10 samples instead of 100 (~90 s).
