# Decisions

Short log of settled decisions. Newest at the bottom. Update when something changes; don't re-debate settled items without new information.

## Platforms and toolchain
- **Windows now, macOS required.** Dev happens on Windows (VS Code + clangd + MSVC + Ninja). macOS support is mandatory: the user's target setup is a headless Mac mini. Don't pick Windows-only rendering tech.
- **JUCE 9** (submodule on master, 9.0.1+).
- **Formats:** Standalone, VST3, CLAP on Windows. Re-add `AU` to `FORMATS` before any macOS/CI build (the CI workflow expects AU on macOS).
- **Debug by default**; Release in `Builds-Release/` for performance testing.
- **GitHub Actions:** triggers off (manual only) while the repo is private, to save minutes.

## Performance targets
- UI frame rate: **30 fps hard floor, 60 fps goal.** "Smooth when a control is touched" is acceptable during style prototyping; optimise hard after the style is settled, but architect for performance from the start.
- **Keep the CPU for DSP.** Offload UI rendering to the GPU wherever possible. Audio and UI run on separate threads (JUCE audio thread vs message thread); keep all UI work off the audio thread.

## Product shape
- **A live-performance control panel and plugin host.** It hosts the user's licensed desktop plugins (iZotope, Kilohearts, FabFilter, Serum 2, Sylenth1, ...) and centralises/abstracts their controls and routing: audio, MIDI and parameters, with two-way parameter comms (live writes; live reads, pushed where the plugin reports changes, periodic resync otherwise).
- **One shared engine, two shells.** Engine = routing graph + plugin hosting + control protocol. Shells: a **plugin** (VST3 first; tested in FL Studio and FL's Patcher) now, a **standalone app** (headless Mac mini in the live rig) later. Keep the engine free of shell-specific code.
- Two-way control of *sibling* plugins in a DAW is impossible via plugin APIs; that's why target plugins are hosted *inside* our plugin.
- **"Brainlessly easy" to run live:** auto-start, restore last session, pick audio device by name, pre-flight status screen, dedicated travel router, tablet opens a saved web app. Mostly standalone-app/setup concerns; design for it.
- **Modularity / failure isolation:** level A now (UI/network failure never affects audio; UI reconnects and resyncs). Level B (watchdog + auto-restart + session restore) is a bonus, standalone only. Level C (plugins in separate processes) later; don't block it architecturally.
- **Hardware MIDI controllers** go straight into the host machine for note playing; the tablet is for control, not timing-critical notes.
- **Max/MSP is not in the core.** RNBO (exports C++ for JUCE) is a possible later route for the user's own DSP modules.

## UI architecture
- **Svelte 5 + Vite + TypeScript** web UI in `ui/` (monorepo). Shown inside the plugin editor via JUCE's `WebBrowserComponent` (WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS) and on tablets/displays via their browser. Release builds embed the built UI.
- **Own WebSocket protocol from day one** for both the local editor and remote devices (one code path). Security: bind to `127.0.0.1` only until LAN mode exists; require a per-session random token on connect; check the `Origin` header (prevents other web pages on the same machine from connecting); serve only files from the UI bundle (no path traversal). LAN mode later: explicit opt-in, pairing code, consider TLS.
- **All glass visuals are rendered in WebGL2 with custom shaders**, not CSS. The panel scene is rendered to textures on a canvas; DOM only for things like text overlays where useful. WebGPU is a possible later upgrade; keep rendering code structured to allow it.
- Required shader capabilities (all available in WebGL2): explicit texture wrap modes (`CLAMP_TO_EDGE`) and/or manual UV clamping in shaders, render-to-texture passes with exact capture bounds, floating-point render targets (`RGBA16F` via `EXT_color_buffer_float`) so additive energy can exceed 1.0 before tone mapping, custom blend maths (additive, plus-lighter, dodge, etc).
- **Signature effect: "edge-clamped convolution blooming".** A thin bright border, when overlapped by a blurred additive element, blooms massively because the blur samples outside the captured bounds as the duplicated edge row (clamp, not transparent). Implement it deliberately (exact capture bounds + clamped sampling + HDR additive compositing), with controllable parameters (bloom gain, extent, per-edge), rather than depending on a browser artifact.

## Rendering / blur (historical)
- The JUCE-native GlassToggleButton prototype (parent snapshot + `applyGaussianBlurEffect`) was a workflow test only. Deleted in 1a (recoverable from commit `3d7b75c`).

## Workflow
- **Style tokens:** all visual constants live in one place, in the web UI (JSON/TS), with a debug tuning panel (sliders/colour pickers, copy/save). Vite hot reload gives live editing. (Replaces the earlier C++ JSON token plan.)
- **Specs:** split into small files under `docs/` (see index in `CLAUDE.md`), not one monolithic blueprint. Behaviour lives in each component's spec; global material rules in `docs/style/glass.md`.
- **Assets:** one SVG per component with named layer ids; states are usually parameters applied in code, not separate files. Separate state SVGs only when geometry actually morphs (matching path structure).
- **Iteration:** FL Studio / Patcher (via the VST3 junction) for in-DAW checks; web UI iterated in a browser with Vite hot reload where possible.
- **Platforms in practice:** build and test on Windows first; keep platform-specific code isolated; test the web UI in Safari early; smoke-test on a Mac at milestones.

## Plan: thin vertical slice (each sub-slice needs the user's go, ideally its own chat session)
1. **1a. Host inside the plugin:** our VST3 loads one VST3 from a fixed path (test plugin: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\Kilohearts\kHs 3-Band EQ.vst3`), passes audio and MIDI through, can open its editor window, lists its parameters. C++ only, no scanning. **Built and FL-verified 2026-09-25** (audio, hosted editor, live values, state in projects and Fruity Wrapper presets). Open: no MIDI event input in Patcher (see Slice 1a notes).
2. **1b. Bridge:** embedded HTTP + WebSocket server (C++ library via CPM, to be chosen), plugin editor shows a minimal Svelte page; one plain slider controls one hosted parameter two-way, including pushed updates when the hosted plugin's own UI changes it.
3. **1c. Shader knob:** the slider becomes a WebGL2 glass/light-scatter knob with a frame-time readout, running inside FL.
- Style work starts after 1c.

## Slice 1a: hosting (2026-09-25)
- **Web UI re-confirmed** after weighing JUCE-only: the Mac is headless, so the tablet is the real screen and a web UI is needed anyway; one Svelte app serves both. 1b/1c double as go/no-go tests for WebView2 inside FL. Fallback: plain JUCE editor in the DAW, web UI still serving tablets over the same protocol.
- **Effect now, instrument soon.** FL only sends piano-roll notes to generators, and hosting synths is core. Switch to an instrument (or FX + instrument variants from the same code) as soon as 1a-1c are verified. Engine code doesn't change; only build flags and bus setup do.
- **Engine code lives in `source/engine/`.** `HostedPlugin` owns one hosted plugin, loaded once on the message thread when our processor is created. No hot-swap yet; swapping while audio runs needs a realtime-safe handover later.
- **Stereo only:** our buses and the hosted plugin's main buses; its sidechain/aux buses are disabled.
- **MIDI:** ours goes into the hosted plugin and its MIDI output becomes ours. Plugins with no MIDI in or out (like the EQ) leave MIDI untouched, so it flows past them.
- **Saved state:** every DAW's wrapper saves a plugin as an opaque blob it asks the plugin for, so we store the hosted plugin's state inside ours (XML, tagged with the plugin's identifier) and only restore it into the same plugin.
- **Threading:** hosted VST3s require `prepareToPlay` and get/set state on the message thread (JUCE asserts). VST3 hosts call ours there, so we forward directly.
- **VST3 parameter lists include MIDI CC slots** (16 channels x 130 controllers); the EQ reports 6 real + 2080 MIDI. `HostedPlugin::getControls()` returns only the real controls (flagged automatable), and the UI shows only those. Expand later for plugins that need longer lists.
- **Our own plugin exposes the same 2080 MIDI CC slots:** JUCE turns on MIDI CC emulation whenever MIDI input is enabled. VST3 has no MIDI CC events; hosts deliver CC, pitch bend and aftertouch as these parameters, so keep it on.
- **Patcher offers no MIDI event input pin** on our plugin (as an effect), though our VST3 declares a proper event input bus and MIDI out works. Likely FL's effect/generator split again; expected to be fixed by the instrument switch.
- Test plugin path: `hostedPluginPath` in `source/PluginProcessor.h`. Loading it adds ~0.2 s to processor construction (visible in the "Boot performance" benchmark, which now takes ~1 min).
